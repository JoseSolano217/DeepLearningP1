One winter day in Gensokyo, a geyser erupts near the Hakurei Shrine and forms a hot spring. However, earth spirits from the underground came up around the hot spring. Despite the presence of the earth spirits, Reimu Hakurei and Marisa Kirisame decide to build a spa on the hot spring, and the earth spirits didn't bother them. Youkai, on the other hand, are suspicious of the sudden appearance of the earth spirits, and they conscript Reimu and Marisa to go underground and investigate for them with a device from Yukari Yakumo to stay in contact. Reimu eventually goes underground to stumble upon a tsurube-otoshi who isn't a real threat. After she meet with Yamame Kurodani, a tsuchigumo. She isn't hostile and even invites Reimu to a feast in the underground. Still, Yukari treats her as an enemy resulting in Yamame getting mad. She attacks, but couldn't stand a chance. Reimu is going further, and deeper underground.
Reimu has no idea where she is now, and when a stranger asks her what she wants in the Former Capital Reimu is left behind with questions. The stranger is Parsee Mizuhashi, a bridge princess able to control people's jealousy. Again, Yukari wants Reimu to defeat her but Reimu only wants the hot springs. Being so jealous, Parsee made a reason to attack her. But she failed, and Reimu moves forward.
Upon reaching the Former Capital, an oni shows up and challenges Reimu for a fight. She says Reimu should keep up with her. Reimu wants her to move away already. She stops, and says her name is Yuugi Hoshiguma. Yuugi and Yukari talks together, Yukari blaming her and the other oni not taking care enough of the earth spirits. Reimu interrupts them, and immediately want to go to the so called Palace of the Earth Spirits. But not before Yuugi once again tries to fight with Reimu. Again, Reimu was the stronger one. They proceed.
As they reach the Palace of the Earth Spirits, a cat just wanders by, attacking them. It ran away just as quickly, though. Eventually Reimu meets another youkai, which strangely enough can read her mind. Not so strange though, as she reveals herself as Satori Komeiji, a satori. She is the master of the Palace of the Earth Spirits. Yukari wants Reimu to finish her already, but she just keeps listening and let Satori read her mind. Satori says the geyser was caused by one of her pets. Satori starts fighting eventually, but looses. She will lead Reimu to deeper underground, to the courtyard of the mansion.
Deeper underground, where it is really hot, the same cat from earlier appears. But this time it turned into Rin Kaenbyou, also known as Orin. She says she listened to Reimu's goal underground, which she better should not do. So they fight, but Reimu is strong enough to beat Orin. Orin gives Reimu a good luck, as the actual culprit, another one of Satori's pet, is even more powerful as that pet had swallowed an actual god. Still, Reimu moves along.
The last part, for the last time, Orin tries to stop them but fails again. So Reimu reaches the other pet. Her name is Utsuho Reiuji, who takes care of the hellfire. She says the geyser can't be stopped due to her ultimate powers. She wants to fight, and after she wins she wants to go to above ground to use her powers. They start fighting, but Reimu ultimately defeats Utsuho. 
Reimu's cleaning up the shrine when Yukari appears and talks about catching Orin and her role in the incident and what to do with her. In the end Reimu keeps her around feeding her some until one day there was news of dead bodies vanishing. 
Although the earth spirits have vanished, Reimu and Marisa still don't know what started the incident, so they asked Utsuho and Orin, who were visiting the Hakurei shrine. Utsuho said that a god came from above ground looking for the strongest hell raven and she got her powers when she claimed she is the strongest hell raven. However, she doesn't remember anything else about the god other than that the god came from a mountain and that said god had a partner. This leads Reimu and Marisa to suspect Kanako and Suwako. 
Later, Reimu decides to pay a visit to the Moriya Shrine for more information. On the way to find the goddess Kanako, Reimu encounters a shrine maiden of the Moriya Shrine, Sanae Kochiya. Sanae is defeated, and then Reimu proceeds to find Kanako. However, Kanako was no where to be seen. However, Reimu encounters someone else, Satori's little sister, Koishi Komeiji. Koishi asks Reimu where the goddess is, but Reimu doesn't know. When Reimu heard Koishi's full name, they instantly knew she was related to Satori. Koishi also knew that Reimu was the human that entered the Palace of Earth Spirits. Koishi heard that Reimu defeated "Okuu" (Utsuho's nickname), meaning Reimu is stronger. Koishi decided to challenge Reimu in a battle. Though, Koishi is defeated. Reimu was trying to find out about the nuclear powers. Koishi was at the Moriya Shrine because she found out it was the goddesses of the Moriya Shrine that gave Utsuho the nuclear powers, and Koishi wanted a "Gloomy Power of Love" for her pets. 
It turns out that Kanako wanted to rekindle the Hell of Blazing Fires as part of a plan to create a nuclear fusion reactor in Gensokyo. Part of the plan involved finding a hell raven, whom Kanako would grant the power of Yatagarasu. The fact that a geyser appeared implies that the plan was a success. In the end, the youkai were comfortable with this, though Reimu was upset that Kanako didn't tell anyone about this before Reimu went underground.
